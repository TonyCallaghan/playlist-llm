                    I'll provide 2 artists potentially from different genres, your task is to generate a playlist connecting these artists through a progression of songs.
                    Each song in the playlist should represent a logical bridge between the styles of genres of the two artists.
                    The connection can be based on elements such as similar sounds, collaborations, influences, or any other meaningful link.
                    The first song must be artist 1, the last song should be artist 2 and you should bridge the gap.
                    Don't include an artist more than twice.
                    Based on the following two artists: 
                    1. ${artist1}
                    2. ${artist2}

                    For each song, include:
                    - The song's name
                    - The artist's name
